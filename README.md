# 2D-Physics-Simulation
This Repository contains my take on simulating some physics concepts I learnt from the high-school curriculum and first year university.

Recently, I decided to remake them into JavaScript using `CanvasRenderingContext2D` for the `<canvas>` element to allow for easy display. And I plan to add upon it in the future for improvement.
